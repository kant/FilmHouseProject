When tragedy strikes, they both struggle to accept the consequences. A once happy relationship is infected with suspicion, paranoia and resentment. Are their responses a natural reaction to trauma, or is there something more sinister afoot? The suspense of finding out will take you to the edge of your seat... "

Their magnetic pull draws us into a queer Romeo and Juliet, as they try to hide their relationship from their politically opposed fathers. <i>Rafiki</i> was the first Kenyan film to be included in the Un Certain Regard section in Cannes earlier this year, and was then controversially banned from being shown in Kenya by the Kenya Film Classification Board.
