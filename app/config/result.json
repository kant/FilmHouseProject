Pulling out a gun to protect her boyfriend and serving five years behind bars for the act, Qiao embarks on a journey to rekindle her relationship with Bin once more. Jia Zhangke's gloriously tragic drama is an arresting, complex gem - using this early 21st century story to echo the relentless tide of capitalism in China - and was nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes.

Wolfgang Fischer's timely moral thriller is one of the most focused and compassionate cinematic depictions of the refugee crisis, winning three awards at Berlin in 2018."
