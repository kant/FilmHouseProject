Shot with a painter’s eye, Schnabel’s once again shows his talent for working with complex biography and the lives of artists."

Equally violent is the state's aversion therapy Alex is forced to endure to cure him of his addiction...\nBold, hypnotic and still hugely impactful almost 50 years on."

Tormented by storms, a boat, a body, and a wooden chest, the mystery plays out as greed, paranoia and dark misdeeds take hold..."
