Pulling out a gun to protect her boyfriend and serving five years behind bars for the act, Qiao embarks on a journey to rekindle her relationship with Bin once more. Jia Zhangke's gloriously tragic drama is an arresting, complex gem - using this early 21st century story to echo the relentless tide of capitalism in China - and was nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes.

Kirk Douglas stars as a man born of a slave woman who has known nothing but chains his entire life. After being forced to put on a gladiator show for wealthy Romans (including Laurence Olivier as the power-hungry Crassus), Spartacus leads a slave revolt across Italy that soon has thousands marching on Rome."

Gideon and Suzie are initially happy to see their mysterious old friend Harry (Danny Glover) when he turns up on their doorstep unannounced. They soon regret their offer of hospitality, however, when Harry’s arrival begins to exercise a strange, almost supernatural presence in the house. What exactly has Harry brought into the house with him, and will Suzie’s family survive it intact? \n"

Calloused to the hostility of the world after years of killing, the pair set off on an epic journey through the Northwest, which will test their brotherhood and also perhaps unearth the last remnants of their humanity. Based on Patrick deWitt's darkly comedic western novel, <i>The Sisters Brothers</i> is the English-language debut of acclaimed French director Jacques Audiard (<i>Rust and Bone</i>, <i>Dheepan</i>) and also stars Riz Ahmed and Jake Gyllenhaal, with cameos from Rutger Hauer and Carol Kane."
