He’s the only one to take seriously a fisherman’s frantic reports of the landing of a metal giant, and his search is rewarded by the sighting of a metal-crunching, electricity-immune 50-foot iron giant in the forest. A friendship between boy and giant grows, but all the while government agents close in. A beautifully animated intelligent adventure that will delight audiences young and old."

One of the most celebrated films on the international festival circuit, filmmaker Samuel Maoz (<i>Lebanon</i>) conjures up an intelligent dark comedy which inspects the bitter absurdities of war and the impact it has on the people involved."

He makes his film debut with a deeply personal portrait of the home he grew up in. As his father Ray (Justin Salinger) slips ever-deeper into alcoholism and with the violent melancholy of his mother Liz (Ella Smith) looming over the household, <i>Ray & Liz</i> is both unflinchingly honest and exquisitely composed. Without indulging in sentimentality, it's a film that spans bleak social realism, dark humour and painful irony."
