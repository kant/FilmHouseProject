This film grabbed me as it shows very intricate details of how Lara copes, and her feelings and pain as she waits for transition surgery. The excellent cinematography effectively conveys the thrill and skill of her dancing. It’s a powerful character study and I believe the film will make audiences empathise with and understand transgender people better. The film has attracted some controversy for casting a cis gender man in the central role. I say, come along and see for yourself.</i>\" - Leon Heun\n"

Meanwhile at home, the parents of one of the boys are devastated by the news of his supposed sudden death, though the circumstances surrounding this take several unexpected twists. One of the most celebrated films on the international festival circuit, filmmaker Samuel Maoz (<i>Lebanon</i>) conjures up an intelligent dark comedy which inspects the bitter absurdities of war and the impact it has on the people involved."

He makes his film debut with a deeply personal portrait of the home he grew up in. As his father Ray (Justin Salinger) slips ever-deeper into alcoholism and with the violent melancholy of his mother Liz (Ella Smith) looming over the household, <i>Ray & Liz</i> is both unflinchingly honest and exquisitely composed. Without indulging in sentimentality, it's a film that spans bleak social realism, dark humour and painful irony."
