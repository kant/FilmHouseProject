When she discovers that a five-year-old in her class may be a poetic prodigy, she becomes fascinated and deeply invested and tries to protect him from what she sees as neglectful parents. She soon finds herself risking her career and family to nurture his talent. Gyllenhaal turns in a subtly disturbing performance in this intelligent and engrossing remake of Nadav Lapid's 2014 Israeli film of the same name."

Set in in a country that still criminalises homosexuality, the two very different girls must choose between love and safety surrounded by insular gossip, local politics and burgeoning maturity. Their magnetic pull draws us into a queer Romeo and Juliet, as they try to hide their relationship from their politically opposed fathers. <i>Rafiki</i> was the first Kenyan film to be included in the Un Certain Regard section in Cannes earlier this year, and was then controversially banned from being shown in Kenya by the Kenya Film Classification Board.
