When she discovers that a five-year-old in her class may be a poetic prodigy, she becomes fascinated and deeply invested and tries to protect him from what she sees as neglectful parents. She soon finds herself risking her career and family to nurture his talent. Gyllenhaal turns in a subtly disturbing performance in this intelligent and engrossing remake of Nadav Lapid's 2014 Israeli film of the same name."
